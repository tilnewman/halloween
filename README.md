# Super Lucky Ninja-Girl Halloween Nightmare Go!
Just the start of a simple game for learning about C++ and SFML.  The point is more to have something for teaching purposes than to have something finished. 

##

* C++17
* Only dependency is [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org)
* Cross Platform (CMake setup for Windows/VS, MacOS/Clang, and Linux/GCC)
* Media files are all [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/)) and in this repo to make deployment super easy
* Spunky
